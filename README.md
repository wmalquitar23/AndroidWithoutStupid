Android Without Stupid
======================
I created Android Without Stupid for use with my Android app Subhash Browser. As this app was
my first Android/Java project, I was surprised to find that I had to write several lines of 
code for even the simplest things. Searching for simpler code always lead me down the 
proverbial banana-monkey-forest route.

Hence, the objective of this library was to minimize the number of lines to accomplish 
common and repetitive jobs.

The first three letters of all classes are uniquely named. And, so are most methods in this 
library. This will help greatly with the autocompletion feature of IDEs.

Many of the methods are static routines and do not require the developer to create an 
instance to call them.

However, some methods require an instance. Usually, the calling activity needs to be 
passed to the constructor as a parameter.
